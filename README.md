# Tectonic Installer

Tectonic is built on pure-upstream Kubernetes but has an opinion on the best way to install and run a Kubernetes cluster. This project helps you install a Kubernetes cluster the "Tectonic Way". It provides good defaults, enables install automation, and is customizable to meet your infrastructure needs.

Goals of the project:

- Install [Self-Hosted Kubernetes Clusters](https://github.com/kubernetes/community/blob/master/contributors/design-proposals/self-hosted-kubernetes.md)
- Secure by default (uses TLS, RBAC by default, OIDC AuthN, etcd)
- Automatable install process for scripts and CI/CD
- Deploy on any infrastructure: Amazon AWS, Microsoft Azure, OpenStack, Google Cloud, bare metal
- Run on any OS: Container Linux (the default), [RHEL](Documentation/install/rhel/installing-workers.md#installing-tectonic-workers-on-red-hat-enterprise-linux), Ubuntu, and others
- Customizable and modular: Change DNS providers, security settings, authentication providers
- Highly Available by default: Deploy all Kubernetes components HA, use etcd Operator

Check the [ROADMAP](ROADMAP.md) for details on where the project is headed.

## Getting Started

**To use a tested release** on a supported platform, follow the links below.

**To hack or modify** the templates or add a new platform, use the scripts in this repo to boot and tear down clusters.

### Official releases

See the official Tectonic documentation:

- [AWS using a GUI](https://coreos.com/tectonic/docs/latest/install/aws/) [[**stable**][platform-lifecycle]]
- [AWS using Terraform CLI](https://coreos.com/tectonic/docs/latest/install/aws/aws-terraform.html) [[**stable**][platform-lifecycle]]
- [Azure using Terraform](https://coreos.com/tectonic/docs/latest/install/azure/azure-terraform.html) [[**stable**][platform-lifecycle]]
- [Bare metal using a GUI](https://coreos.com/tectonic/docs/latest/install/bare-metal/) [[**stable**][platform-lifecycle]]
- [Bare metal using Terraform CLI](https://coreos.com/tectonic/docs/latest/install/bare-metal/metal-terraform.html) [[**stable**][platform-lifecycle]]

### Hacking

These instructions can be used for the official stable platforms listed above, and for the following alpha/beta platforms:

- [OpenStack via Terraform](Documentation/install/openstack/openstack-terraform.md) [[**alpha**][platform-lifecycle]]
- [VMware via Terraform](Documentation/install/vmware/vmware-terraform.md) [[**alpha**][platform-lifecycle]]

**Go and Source**

[Install Go](https://golang.org/doc/install) if not already installed.

Then get the Tectonic Installer source code:

```
go get github.com/coreos/tectonic-installer
cd $(go env GOPATH)/src/github.com/coreos/tectonic-installer
```

**Terraform**

The Tectonic Installer releases include a build of [Terraform](https://terraform.io). See the [Tectonic Installer release notes][release-notes] for information about which Terraform versions are compatible.

The [latest Terraform binary](https://www.terraform.io/downloads.html) may not always work as Tectonic Installer, which sometimes relies on bug fixes or features not yet available in the official Terraform release.

**Yarn (optional)**

The [Yarn](https://yarnpkg.com) JavaScript package manager is required for building the frontend code. On OS X, install using Homebrew: `brew install yarn`.

#### Common Usage

**Choose your platform**

First, set the `PLATFORM=` environment variable. This example will use `PLATFORM=azure`.

- `PLATFORM=openstack` [OpenStack via Terraform](Documentation/install/openstack/openstack-terraform.md) [[**alpha**][platform-lifecycle]]
- `PLATFORM=vmware` [VMware via Terraform](Documentation/install/vmware/vmware-terraform.md) [[**alpha**][platform-lifecycle]]

**Initiate the Cluster Configuration**

Use `make` to create a new directory `build/<cluster-name>` to hold all module references, Terraform state files, and custom variable files.

```
PLATFORM=azure CLUSTER=my-cluster make localconfig
```

**Configure Cluster**

Set variables in the `build/<cluster-name>/terraform.tfvars` file as needed. Available variables are found in the `platforms/<PLATFORM>/config.tf` and `platforms/<PLATFORM>/variables.tf` files.

Examples for each platform can be found in [the examples directory](examples/).

**Terraform Lifecycle**

`plan`, `apply`, and `destroy` are provided as `make` targets to ease the build directory and custom binary complexity.

```
PLATFORM=azure CLUSTER=my-cluster make plan
```

```
PLATFORM=azure CLUSTER=my-cluster make apply
```

```
PLATFORM=azure CLUSTER=my-cluster make destroy
```

#### Tests

See [tests/README.md](tests/README.md).
