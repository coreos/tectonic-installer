# Tectonic Installer
![Build Status](https://jenkins-tectonic-installer-public.prod.coreos.systems/buildStatus/icon?job=coreos%20-%20tectonic-installer/tectonic-installer/master)

Tectonic is built on pure upstream Kubernetes but has an opinion on the best way to install and run a Kubernetes cluster. This project helps you install a Kubernetes cluster the "Tectonic Way". It provides good defaults, enables install automation, and is customizable to meet your infrastructure needs.

Goals of the project:

- Installation of [Self-Hosted Kubernetes Cluster](https://github.com/kubernetes/community/blob/master/contributors/design-proposals/self-hosted-kubernetes.md)
- Secure by default (use TLS, RBAC by default, OIDC AuthN, etcd)
- Automatable install process for scripts and CI/CD
- Deploy Tectonic on any infrastructure (Amazon, Azure, OpenStack, GCP, etc)
- Runs Tectonic on any OS (Container Linux, RHEL, CentOS, etc)
- Customizable and modular (change DNS providers, security settings, etc)
- HA by default (deploy all Kubernetes components HA, use etcd Operator)

Checkout the [ROADMAP](ROADMAP.md) for details on where the project is headed.

**To use a tested release** on an supported platform, follow the links below.

**To hack or modify** the templates or add a new platform, use the scripts in this repo to boot and tear down clusters.

## Installing on supported platforms

See the official Tectonic documentation:

- [AWS using a GUI](https://coreos.com/tectonic/docs/latest/install/aws/) [[**stable**][platform-lifecycle]]
- [AWS using Terraform CLI](https://coreos.com/tectonic/docs/latest/install/aws/aws-terraform.html) [[**stable**][platform-lifecycle]]
- [Bare metal using a GUI](https://coreos.com/tectonic/docs/latest/install/bare-metal/) [[**stable**][platform-lifecycle]]
- [Bare metal using Terraform CLI](https://coreos.com/tectonic/docs/latest/install/bare-metal/metal-terraform.html) [[**stable**][platform-lifecycle]]
- [Azure via Terraform](Documentation/install/azure/azure-terraform.md) [[**stable**][platform-lifecycle]]

## Hacking

These instructions can be used for the official stable platforms listed above, and for the following alpha/beta platforms:


- [OpenStack via Terraform](Documentation/install/openstack/openstack-terraform.md) [[**alpha**][platform-lifecycle]]
- [VMware via Terraform](Documentation/install/vmware/vmware-terraform.md) [[**alpha**][platform-lifecycle]]

**Go and Source**

[Install Go](https://golang.org/doc/install) if not already installed.

Then get the Tectonic Installer source code:

```
go get github.com/coreos/tectonic-installer
cd $(go env GOPATH)/src/github.com/coreos/tectonic-installer
```

**Terraform**

The Tectonic Installer releases include a build of [Terraform](https://terraform.io). See the [Tectonic Installer release notes][release-notes] for information about which Terraform versions are compatible.

The [latest Terraform binary](https://www.terraform.io/downloads.html) may not always work as Tectonic Installer, which sometimes relies on bug fixes or features not yet available in the official Terraform release.

**Yarn (optional)**

The [Yarn](https://yarnpkg.com) JavaScript package manager is required for building the frontend code. On OS X, install via Homebrew: `brew install yarn`.

### Common Usage

#### Choose your platform

First, set the `PLATFORM=` environment variable. This example will use `PLATFORM=azure`.

- `PLATFORM=azure` [Azure via Terraform](Documentation/install/azure/azure-terraform.md) [[**alpha**][platform-lifecycle]]
- `PLATFORM=openstack` [OpenStack via Terraform](Documentation/install/openstack/openstack-terraform.md) [[**alpha**][platform-lifecycle]]
- `PLATFORM=vmware` [VMware via Terraform](Documentation/install/vmware/vmware-terraform.md) [[**alpha**][platform-lifecycle]]

#### Initiate the Cluster Configuration

Using make create a new directory `build/<cluster-name>` to hold all module references, Terraform state files, and custom variable files.

```
PLATFORM=azure CLUSTER=my-cluster make localconfig
```

#### Configure Cluster

Set variables in the `build/<cluster-name>/terraform.tfvars` file as needed. Available variables are found in the `platforms/<PLATFORM>/config.tf` and `platforms/<PLATFORM>/variables.tf` files.

Examples for each platform can be found in [the examples directory](examples/).

#### Terraform Lifecycle

Plan, apply, and destroy are provided as `make` targets to ease the build directory and custom binary complexity.

```
PLATFORM=azure CLUSTER=my-cluster make plan
```

```
PLATFORM=azure CLUSTER=my-cluster make apply
```

```
PLATFORM=azure CLUSTER=my-cluster make destroy
```

### Tests

Tests are run for all approved pull requests via Jenkins. See the [Jenkinsfile](./Jenkinsfile) for details.

Tests can be run locally by:

**AWS**

```
export PLATFORM="aws"
export AWS_REGION="us-east-1"
export {TF_VAR_tectonic_cluster_name,CLUSTER}=my-smoke-test
export TF_VAR_tectonic_license_path=/path/to/license.txt
export TF_VAR_tectonic_pull_secret_path=/path/to/pull-secret.json

make localconfig
ln -sf ../../test/aws.tfvars build/${TF_VAR_tectonic_cluster_name}/terraform.tfvars
make plan
make apply
make destroy
```

### Notes

#### Limitations of HTTP headers

Large group counts will not work with reverse proxies that limit HTTP headers to 4K. These counts will return an error similar to that returned for a cookie based approach. "Normal" HTTP header setups will support 1M header.

To work with large-client-header-buffers: set `tectonic-custom-error` on the Ingress Configmap to `4 64k` to increase the limit in Ingress to EG 64k. See the nginx docs on the flag.
