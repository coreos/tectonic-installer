# Node bootstrapping flow

This is a development document which describes the bootstrapping flow for ContainerLinux nodes provisioned by the tectonic-installer as part of a Tectonic cluster.

## Overview

When a cluster node is being bootstrapped from scratch, it goes through several phases in the following order:

1. first-boot OS configuration, via ignition (systemd units, node configuration, etc)
1. provisioning of additional assets (k8s manifests, TLS material), via either of:
   * pushing from terraform file/remote-exec (SSH)
   * pulling from private cloud stores (S3 buckets)
1. if needed, a node reboot is triggered to apply systemd-wide changes and to clean container runtime datadir
1. `kubelet.service` picks up the `kubelet.env` file and actually starts the kubelet as a rkt-fly service.

Additionally, only on one of the master nodes the following kubernetes bootstrapping happens:

1. `bootkube.service` is started after `kubelet.service` start
1. a static bootstrapping control-plane is deployed
1. a fully self-hosted control-plane starts and takes over the previous one
1. `bootkube.service` is completed with success
1. `tectonic.service` is started
1. a self-hosted tectonic control-plane is deployed
1. `tectonic.service` is completed with success

## Systemd units

The following systemd units are deployed to a node by tectonic-installer and take part in the bootstrapping process:

* `kubelet.service` is the main kubelet daemon. It is automatically started on boot, it is crash-looping until `kubelet.env` is populated, and it runs on each boot

Additionally, only on one of the master nodes the following kubernetes bootstrapping happens:

* `bootkube.service` deploys the initial bootstrapping control-plane. It is started only after `kubelet.service` _is started_. It is a oneshot unit and cannot crash, and it runs only during bootstrap
* `bootkube.path` waits for bootkube assets/scripts to exist on disk and triggers `bootkube.service`
* `tectonic.service` deploys tectonic control-plane. It is started only after `bootkube.service` _has completed_.  It is a oneshot unit and cannot crash, and it runs only during bootstrap
* `bootkube.path` waits for tectonic assets/scripts to exist on disk and triggers `tectonic.service`

## Service ordering

Service ordering is enforced via systemd dependencies. This is the rationale for the settings, with relevant snippets:

### `kubelet.service`

```
EnvironmentFile=/etc/kubernetes/kubelet.env
ExecStart=/usr/lib/coreos/kubelet-wrapper [...]
Restart=always
WantedBy=multi-user.target
```

This service is enabled by default and can crash-loop until success.
It crash-loop until the `kubelet.env` file exists.
It is started on every boot.

### `bootkube.path` and `bootkube.service`

```
ConditionPathExists=!/opt/tectonic/init_bootkube.done
Wants=kubelet.service
After=kubelet.service
Type=oneshot
RemainAfterExit=true
ExecStart=/usr/bin/bash /opt/tectonic/bootkube.sh
ExecStartPost=/bin/touch /opt/tectonic/init_bootkube.done
```

Bootkube service unit is not enabled by default. It is instead triggered by a path unit, which waits for assets written synchronously by terraform.

This service waits for kubelet to be *started* via systemd dependency.
It is a oneshot service, thus marked as started only once the script return with success.
It is skipped on further boots, as the condition-path exists.

### `tectonic.path` and `tectonic.service`

```
ConditionPathExists=!/opt/tectonic/init_tectonic.done
Requires=bootkube.service
After=bootkube.service
Type=oneshot
RemainAfterExit=true
ExecStart=/usr/bin/bash /opt/tectonic/tectonic-wrapper.sh
ExecStartPost=/bin/touch /opt/tectonic/init_tectonic.done
```

Tectonic service unit is not enabled by default. It is instead triggered by a path unit, which waits for assets written synchronously by terraform.

This service waits for bootkube process to be *completed* via systemd dependency.
It is a oneshot service, thus marked as started only once the script returns with success.
It is skipped on further boots, as the condition-path exists.

### `rm-assets.path` and `rm-assets.service`

This service waits for the bootkube and tectonic process to be completed.
It is a oneshot service, thus marked as started only once the script returns with success.
This is an optional service only present on platforms which pull assets from block storage.
