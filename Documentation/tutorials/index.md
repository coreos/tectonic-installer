# Welcome to the Tectonic tutorials!

Thank you for your interest in CoreOS Tectonic. We hope you’re excited to learn how Tectonic works and how enterprise-ready Kubernetes can improve your organization’s application infrastructure.

To help you get up and running with Tectonic, we have designed these step-by-step tutorials. In them, we will walk you through:

1. [Creating an AWS account][creating-aws]
2. [Downloading and installing Tectonic on AWS][installing-tectonic]
3. Using Tectonic
 * 3.1. [Deploying an application][first-app]
 * 3.2. [Scaling an application][scale-app]
 * 3.3. [Versioning an application][rolling-deploy]
 * 3.4. [Deleting an application][deleting-deployment]

*For the purpose of these exercises, we will lead you through the set-up process for AWS.*

## Creating your Tectonic account

If you haven’t already done so, you can [create your Tectonic account now][create-acct], or do it as you move through the tutorials. Tectonic is free for use of up to 10 nodes.

*We will continue adding to these tutorials. Be sure to return and check for updates.*
