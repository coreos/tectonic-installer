Leave blank to have a new one created.<br><br>Note this is the complete ID as returned in the "id" field by the Azure client, not just the name of the resource.<br><br>Example: "/subscriptions/b520eabf-d6c0-4757-8a5e-0fa7d2fe12b5/resourceGroups/my-k8s-cluster/providers/Microsoft.Network/networkSecurityGroups/my-worker-nsg | string | `` |
| tectonic_azure_external_resource_group | (optional) Name of an external resource group to place created resources in. Leave blank to have a new one created. | string | `` |
| tectonic_azure_external_vnet_id | (optional) Resource ID of an existing Virtual Network to launch nodes into. Leave blank to create a new Virtual Network.<br><br>Note this is the complete ID as returned in the "id" field by the Azure client, not just the name of the resource.<br><br>Example: /subscriptions/b520eabf-d6c0-4757-8a5e-0fa7d2fe12b5/resourceGroups/my-k8s-cluster/providers/Microsoft.Network/virtualNetworks/my-k8s-vnet | string | `` |
| tectonic_azure_external_worker_subnet_id | (optional) Subnet ID within an existing VNet to deploy worker nodes into. Required to use an existing VNet.<br><br>Note this is the complete ID as returned in the "id" field by the Azure client, not just the name of the resource.<br><br>Example: "/subscriptions/b520eabf-d6c0-4757-8a5e-0fa7d2fe12b5/resourceGroups/my-k8s-cluster/providers/Microsoft.Network/virtualNetworks/test-pre-vnet/subnets/my-k8s-subnet | string | `` |
| tectonic_azure_extra_tags | (optional) A map of extra Azure tags to be applied to created resources. NOTE: Tags MUST NOT contain reserved characters '<,>,%,&,\,?,/' or control characters. | map | `<map>` |
| tectonic_azure_location | (internal) An Azure location where the cluster will be built. Use the location name as returned in the *Name* column by `az account list-locations` CLI command. Lowercase string with no spaces between words. Example: southcentralus | string | - |
| tectonic_azure_location_fault_domains | (internal) This mapping is for internal use only. It should not be overriden by users. It holds the correspondent number of fault domains for each location, because Azure doesn't provide an API call to query this data per location. The latest version of this data is always available at this location: https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/virtual-machines/windows/manage-availability | map | `<map>` |
| tectonic_azure_master_storage_type | (optional) Storage account type for the master node(s). Example: Premium_LRS.

| tectonic_azure_master_vm_size | (optional) Instance size for the master node(s). Example: Standard_DS2_v2. | string | `Standard_DS2_v2` |
| tectonic_azure_private_cluster | (optional) Setting this to true will result in NO public facing endpoints being created. All traffic is contained within the VNET. A VNET with an already configured and active VPN connection is required and needs to be supplied via 'tectonic_azure_external_vnet_id'. DNS is currently required, either the Azure managed one or configured via the generic DNS module. | string | `false` |
| tectonic_azure_ssh_key | (required) Path to an SSH public key file to be provisioned as the SSH key for the 'core' user. | string | - |
| tectonic_azure_ssh_network_external | (optional) Network (external) to allow SSH access from. Maps to `source_address_prefix` in Azure. Defaults to `*`. Can be external to Azure environment. Allowed values: [network CIDR (i.e., 10.0.0.0/16) \| `VirtualNetwork` \| `Internet` \| `*` ] | string | `*` |
| tectonic_azure_ssh_network_internal | (optional) Network (internal) to allow SSH access from. Maps to `source_address_prefix` in Azure. Defaults to `VirtualNetwork`. Should be internal to Azure environment. Allowed values: [network CIDR (i.e., 10.0.0.0/16) \| `VirtualNetwork` \| `Internet` \| `*` ] | string | `VirtualNetwork` |
| tectonic_azure_vnet_cidr_block | (optional) Range of IP addresses assigned to the Virtual Network in which the cluster nodes run. This should not overlap with any other networks, such as the Kubernetes cluster (pod) range, service range or a private datacenter connected via ExpressRoute." | string | `10.0.0.0/16` |
| tectonic_azure_worker_storage_type | (optional) Storage account type for the worker node(s). Example: Premium_LRS. Using Premium storage is constrained by the of instance specified in 'tectonic_azure_worker_vm_size'. See https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/storage/storage-premium-storage#supported-vms | string | `Premium_LRS` |
| tectonic_azure_worker_vm_size | (optional) Instance size for the worker node(s). Example: Standard_DS2_v2. | string | `Standard_DS2_v2` |
