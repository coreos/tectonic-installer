This document gives an overview of the variables used in the different platforms of the Tectonic SDK.

## Inputs

| Name | Description | Default | Required |
|------|-------------|:-----:|:-----:|
| tectonic_aws_az_count | Number of Availability Zones your EC2 instances will be deployed across. This should be less than or equal to the total number available in the region. Be aware that some regions only have 2. | `3` | no |
| tectonic_aws_etcd_ec2_type | Instance size for the etcd node(s). Example: t2.medium. | `t2.medium` | no |
| tectonic_aws_external_master_subnet_ids | List of subnet IDs within an existing VPC to deploy master nodes into. Required to use an existing VPC and the list must match the AZ count. Example: ["subnet-111111", "subnet-222222", "subnet-333333"] | `<list>` | no |
| tectonic_aws_external_vpc_id | ID of an existing VPC to launch nodes into. Example: vpc-123456. Leave blank to create a new VPC. | `` | no |
| tectonic_aws_external_worker_subnet_ids | List of subnet IDs within an existing VPC to deploy worker nodes into. Required to use an existing VPC and the list must match the AZ count. Example: ["subnet-111111", "subnet-222222", "subnet-333333"] | `<list>` | no |
| tectonic_aws_master_ec2_type | Instance size for the master node(s). Example: t2.medium. | `t2.medium` | no |
| tectonic_aws_ssh_key | Name of an SSH key located within the AWS region. Example: coreos-user. | - | yes |
| tectonic_aws_vpc_cidr_block | Block of IP addresses used by the VPC. This should not overlap with any other networks, such as a private datacenter connected via Direct Connect. | `10.0.0.0/16` | no |
| tectonic_aws_worker_ec2_type | Instance size for the worker node(s). Example: t2.medium. | `t2.medium` | no |
