# Roadmap

This is an unprioritized list of future items the team would like to tackle:

- Run [Kubernetes e2e tests](https://github.com/coreos-inc/tectonic-platform-sdk/issues/6) over repo automatically
- Build a tool to walk the Terraform graph and warn if cluster won't comply with [Generic Platform](https://github.com/coreos-inc/tectonic-platform-sdk/blob/master/Documentation/generic-platform.md)
- Additional platforms like Azure, VMware, Google Cloud, etc
- Create a spec for generic and platform specific Terraform Variable files
- Document how to customize each of the platforms
- Create a tool to verify Terraform Variable files
- Deploy with other self-hosted tools like kubeadm
- Terraform plugin and integration with [matchbox](https://github.com/coreos/matchbox) for bare metal
